How to describe Bali in a few words? Imagine lush vegetation, endless rice terraces, white and black beaches, world-class surfing, ancient culture, countless temples and volcanic mountains. And all of this can be found on one tropical island: Bali.</p>

<p>1) Get lost in Bali temples<br/>

Bali’s highlands and coasts are home to many ancient temples. Several of them have become the island’s most iconic landmarks, featuring magnificent centuries-old architecture and set against the exotic backdrops. Lively processions, ornate decorations and festivity take place during temple anniversaries, which come around twice a Gregorian year based on a local 210-day calendar.</p>

<p>Tanah Lot is perhaps the most frequently featured temple on Bali’s postcards due to its unique offshore setting and sunset backdrops. The temple is located on the coast of Beraban village in the Tabanan regency, featuring an ancient Hindu shrine perched on top of an outcrop amidst constantly crashing waves. It is simply among Bali’s not-to-be-missed highlights on tours to Bali’s west, but is also an easy standalone trip – only a 45-minute drive from Kuta. The onshore site consists of smaller onshore village temples alongside visitors’ leisure facilities that comprise restaurants, shops and a cultural park presenting regular dance performances. The best time to visit is during the holy day of Kuningan, when pilgrimages usually take place, and on the temple’s anniversary five days after.</p>

<p>3) Explore the endless Bali rice terraces<br/>

Tegallalang Rice Terraces in Ubud is famous for its beautiful scenes of rice paddies involving the subak (traditional Balinese cooperative irrigation system), which according to history, was passed down by a revered holy man named Rsi Markandeya in the eighth century. Tegallalang forms the three most splendid terraced landscapes in Ubud's shared region, with the others being in the villages of Pejeng and Campuhan.</p>

<p>4) Relax & get a massage<br/>
You can’t go to Bali and not get a full body massage ! Try out Seminak and Ubud</p>

<p>5) Of course!! Work on your taint and go to the beach<br/>

Better known for its main seaport in east Bali, Padangbai comprises a small collection of hidden beaches that are great for day trippers, as well as diving and snorkelling. Blue Lagoon, a small bay northeast of the seaport has only a 60m stretch of white sand</p>

<p>A favourite surf spot, Balangan is on the northern side of the cliff that forms the signature hole 15 of the New Kuta Golf course. The name ‘Balangan’ itself was thought to apply to the whole coastline including Dreamland, before surfers nicknamed the specific shore area south of the cliff.</p>

<p>Amed spans seven different seaside villages: Amed, Jemeluk, Bunutan, Lipah, Selang, Banyuning and Aas. All are fishing villages, hence the classic scene of traditional jukung outriggers lining the coast. Famous as a dive spot, the quiet shores with its dramatic sunrises are a not-to-miss sight if you’re staying here.</p>
